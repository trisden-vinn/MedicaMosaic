        <h1>MedicaMosaic - Hippocrates and the Oath</h1>
        <p>Exploring the Legacy of the Father of Medicine</p>
    </header>

    <article>
        <h2>Hippocrates</h2>
        <p>Hippocrates, born around 460 BCE on the island of Kos, Greece, is widely recognized as a foundational figure in the history of medicine. Revered as the "Father of Medicine," he played a pivotal role in shaping ancient Greek medical practices. Hippocrates emphasized systematic observation, clinical examination, and a holistic approach to healthcare, setting the stage for the development of medical principles.</p>

        <h2>Legacy of Healing</h2>

        <h2>1.The Hippocratic Oath</h2>
        <p>The Hippocratic Oath is a venerable ethical code that traces its origins to the teachings of Hippocrates. Taken by physicians upon entering the medical profession, it serves as a guiding framework for moral conduct. The oath underscores the physician's commitment to prioritizing patient well-being, maintaining confidentiality, and upholding the utmost standards of honesty and integrity. While variations exist, the fundamental principles endure, symbolizing the enduring importance of ethical considerations in the medical field.</p>

        <h2>2.Hippocratic Corpus</h2>
        <p>A collection of medical texts attributed to Hippocrates and his followers, covering various aspects of medicine, including diagnoses, treatments, and ethical principles.</p>

       <h2>3.Humoral Theory</h2>
        <p>He developed the humoral theory, proposing that an imbalance of bodily fluids (blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile) was the root cause of diseases.</p>

       <h2>4.Holistic Approach</h2>
        <p>Hippocrates advocated for a holistic approach to medicine, considering the patient's overall well-being and environment, not just focusing on individual symptoms.</p>
